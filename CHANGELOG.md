# Changelog

## 1.7.0
- All options can now be configured through `appsettings.json`.
- New option to provide Google Application Credentials as JSON text.

## 1.6.0
- Improved handling of scalar values in JSON output by pattern matching on type instead of attempting to parse to double.
- WARNING: JSON output only accepts numeric values as `double` so all numbers will be converted. Large integers and floating-point values will lose precision. If you want the exact value preserved then send then log it as a string instead.

## 1.5.0
- Added support for .NET Core Configuration API, using [`serilog-settings-configuration`](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-settings-configuration)
- Labels can be provided in options object constructor or set using properties. Both will be merged together.
