# Changelog

Readme: https://github.com/manigandham/serilog-sinks-googlecloudlogging/blob/master/README.md

## 3.6.0
- Add `TraceSampled` to log correlation set of properties.
- Update documentation.

## 3.5.0
- Refactored sink to accept [`ITextFormatter`](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Formatting-Output#custom-text-formatters) for full control over rendering a log event.
- Config validation on sink initialization will throw exceptions for known bad config values.
- Performance improvements and reduced allocations.

## 3.4.0
- Enabled nullable reference types for project and updated type definitions for extra safety.
- Improved XML comments and documentation.
- Updated nuget references to latest versions.

## 3.3.3
- Added `UseLogCorrelation` option to allow log integration with [Google Cloud Trace](https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/trace-log-integration). Defaults to `true`.
- Fixed bug with incorrect log correlation trace/span ids.
- Updated nuget references to latest versions.
- Added `net5.0` framework target.

## 3.3.0
- Added new config property for minimal logging level for sink.
- Added support for level switch to change minimum logging level at runtime.

## 3.2.0
- Updated nuget references and used new `IBatchedLogEventSink` interface for `Serilog.Sinks.PeriodicBatching`.
- Fixed bug with `IBatchedLogEventSink` implementation.
- Added `QueueSize` parameter for internal batching queue. See [`PeriodicBatchingSinkOptions`](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-sinks-periodicbatching/blob/dev/src/Serilog.Sinks.PeriodicBatching/Sinks/PeriodicBatching/PeriodicBatchingSinkOptions.cs) for details.

## 3.0.0
- Updated Nuget references, including `Google.Cloud.Logging.V2` to 3.0.0. 
- Dropped support for `netstandard1.5`.

## 2.4.1
- Updated to simpler GCP `LoggingServiceV2Client` instantiation for better compatibility with latest libraries.

## 2.4.0
- Improved logging performance (`StringWriter` reuse) and cache log names (using a static dictionary).

## 2.3.0
- Log names are automatically formatted to match requirements (trim unsafe characters and apply URL encoding).

## 2.2.1
- Updated nuget references to latest versions.

## 2.2.0
- Resource type will use explicitly defined option, or will be automatically discovered with a fallback to `Global`.

## 2.1.1
- `netstandard2.0` added to target frameworks to reduce dependency graph in newer platforms. See guidance at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/library-guidance/cross-platform-targeting
- Replaced `ProjectIconUrl` with local `ProjectIcon` in `csproj` file for nuget packaging.

## 2.1.0
- Resource type is no longer required and will be automatically discovered if program is running in GCP (AppEngine, GCE, GKE, etc).
- Project ID is no longer required and will be automatically set to the host project if program is running in GCP.

## 2.0.0
- Breaking: `ErrorReportingServiceName` and `ErrorReportingServiceVersion` config options changed to `ServiceName` and `ServiceVersion`.
- Service name and version metadata will be added to all log entries, and will allow exceptions at any level to be picked up by StackDriver error reporting.
- Improved log formatting and excepting handling.
- Better performance and less allocations.

## 1.10.0
- Fixed bug if there is no exception attached for "Error" entry.

## 1.9.0
- Added ability for log entries logged as "Error" to be sent to StackDriver error reporting.

## 1.7.0
- All options can now be configured through `appsettings.json`.
- New option to provide Google Application Credentials as JSON text.

## 1.6.0
- Improved handling of scalar values in JSON output by pattern matching on type instead of attempting to parse to double.
- WARNING: JSON output only accepts numeric values as `double` so all numbers will be converted. Large integers and floating-point values will lose precision. If you want the exact value preserved then send then log it as a string instead.

## 1.5.0
- Added support for .NET Core Configuration API, using [`serilog-settings-configuration`](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-settings-configuration)
- Labels can be provided in options object constructor or set using properties. Both will be merged together.
- Added [SourceLink](https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink) support for source-code debugging.

## 1.4.7
- Added `ResourceLabels` configuration option to support additional labels for the Resource type.

## 1.4.6
- Fixed null value handling (logged as empty string) in text output.

## 1.4.5
- Additional data type handling for null, bool, numeric, and string scalar values in JSON/Protobuf output.

## 1.4.0
- Support fully structured logging in GCP via JSON/Protobuf output with configuration option.

## 1.3.1
- More efficient iteration of attached properties.

## 1.3.0
- Fixed property handling to handle all Serilog types: `ScalarValue`, `SequenceValue`, `StructureValue`, `DictionaryValue`.

## 1.2.0
- Option to disable automatic `SourceContext` property.
- Added TestWeb project to diagnose log output.

## 1.1.0
- Fixed property handling to support scalar and nested properties.

## 1.0.0
- Sink created for GCP stack driver.
